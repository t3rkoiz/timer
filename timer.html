How can i get a countdown/timer widget in notion
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To add a countdown/timer widget in Notion, you can use the following method:

Using a Third-Party Widget:
Visit a widget service like Indify, Apption, or WidgetBox.
Sign up or log in to create a countdown or timer widget.
Customize the countdown (date, time, style, etc.).
Copy the embed link provided by the service.
Go to your Notion page, paste the link, and select "Create Embed."
The countdown timer will appear directly on your Notion page.
This method allows for easy customization and integration into your existing Notion setup.

I want one that allows me to customize the timer on the notion page itself, I need to be able to set between 1 and 48 hour timers

To have a customizable timer directly within Notion, you can use Pomo Timer from Apption, which allows for some customization directly on your Notion page:

Set Up Pomo Timer:

Visit Pomo Timer on Apption.
Create a Pomo Timer widget that allows setting short and long intervals. While it's primarily a Pomodoro timer, you can adjust the intervals to your liking.
Customize the timer settings, choosing between short or long sessions (you can adjust to match the hours you need).
Copy the embed link.
Embed in Notion:

Go to your Notion page.
Paste the Pomo Timer embed link, then choose "Create Embed."
The timer will be embedded in your Notion page, and you can start or stop it as needed.
Alternative Method:
For more control and flexibility directly within Notion, consider using the Indify Custom Timer widget, which might offer more customization options than Pomo Timer, but youâ€™ll need to preset the timer intervals via the Indify interface before embedding.

Direct native customization of timers within Notion itself is limited, so using these external widget services is currently the best approach.

None of these work

If you need a fully customizable timer directly within Notion without relying on external widget services, unfortunately, Notion doesn't have native support for this kind of functionality. However, I can suggest a workaround that might meet your needs:

Using a Simple Script + Embed Block (for advanced users):
Create a Simple Timer Using HTML/JavaScript:

You can write a simple HTML/JavaScript code for a countdown timer.
Host this script on a service like CodePen or GitHub Pages.
Embed the Script in Notion:

Copy the link to your hosted timer.
In Notion, use the /embed command and paste the link.
This will embed the timer directly into your Notion page, where you can control it via the script.
Example HTML/JavaScript Timer:
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Custom Timer</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="timer">00:00:00</h1>
    <input type="number" id="hours" placeholder="Hours">
    <input type="number" id="minutes" placeholder="Minutes">
    <input type="number" id="seconds" placeholder="Seconds">
    <button onclick="startTimer()">Start Timer</button>

    <script>
        function startTimer() {
            var hours = parseInt(document.getElementById('hours').value) || 0;
            var minutes = parseInt(document.getElementById('minutes').value) || 0;
            var seconds = parseInt(document.getElementById('seconds').value) || 0;
            var totalSeconds = hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + seconds;
            var timerDisplay = document.getElementById('timer');

            var interval = setInterval(function() {
                var h = Math.floor(totalSeconds / 3600);
                var m = Math.floor((totalSeconds % 3600) / 60);
                var s = totalSeconds % 60;
                timerDisplay.textContent = `${h.toString().padStart(2, '0')}:${m.toString().padStart(2, '0')}:${s.toString().padStart(2, '0')}`;

                if (totalSeconds <= 0) {
                    clearInterval(interval);
                }

                totalSeconds--;
            }, 1000);
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
Steps:
Host the code: Place this code in an HTML file and host it on a platform like GitHub Pages.
Embed in Notion: Embed the URL in your Notion page.
This method requires some basic coding knowledge and the ability to host the file, but it provides the customization you're looking for directly within Notion.
